# Hello Everyone :hand:

## The month of Open-Source Celebration is finally here!!

This repo will be a great platform for those who want to learn **Problem Solving **:

### I will be adding a lot of problems which I solve in different Sites like :

  1. Hackerrank
  2. Hackerearth
  3. Leetcode
  
      1. Monthly Challenges
      2. Interview Problems
      3. Data Structure and Algorithms Problem
      
### You can even contribute to this repo by adding the problems which are not alreadt added and you can help others in learning and understanding loads of codes

### Plz add codes with comment on it ( Seems to be a good practice to code and it helps to learn also).

### Let's make this even fun by asking you to add 2 lines of comments to state what's your name, and where you're from!

For example, this code in Python:

```python
#Ashwin Jain
#India
print("I love your repository")
```
